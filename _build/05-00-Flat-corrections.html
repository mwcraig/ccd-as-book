<p>The purpose of flat corrections is to compensate for any non-uniformity in the
response of the CCD to light. There can be several reasons that the response is
not uniform across the detector:</p>
<ul>
<li>variations in the sensitivity of pixels in the detector, though this source is
usually small.</li>
<li>dust on either the filter or the glass window covering the detector.</li>
<li>vignetting, a dimming in the corners of the image.</li>
<li>anything else in the optical path that affects how much light reaches the
sensor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fix for the non-uniformity is the same in all cases: take an image in which
the illumination is uniform and use that to measure the response of the CCD.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, achieving uniform illumination is difficult, and uniform
illumination with the same spectrum as the astronomical objects of interest to
you is impossible.</p>

<p>There are a few ways of taking "flat" images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twilight flats are images of the sky near zenith taken around sunrise or
sunset.</li>
<li>Dome flats are images of the inside of the dome (typically of a smooth
surface, not of the dome itself),  illuminated by some light source in the dome.
For smaller telescopes an electroluminescent or LED illuminated panel can be
used as the light source.</li>
<li>Sky flats are composed of several science images.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally the flat images have fairly high counts (roughly half the maximum counts
of the detector) so that the <em>only</em> important source of error is Poisson error
due to the light in the flat images, and so that the signal-to-noise ratio in
those images is essentially zero.</p>

<p>The process of calibrating and combining flat frames is largely the same
regardless of the light source being used.</p>
<p>It is useful to think of flat frames as just like science images of stars or
galaxies. The telescope is taking a picture of a light source, so bias and dark
need to be removed from the individual images.</p>
<p>When combining the images there is a new step we have not discussed yet:
normalizing (also called rescaling) the calibrated flat frames to a common mean
or median before combining them. In both sky and twilight flats the illumination
varies naturally from frame-to-frame. If the images are not scaled to a common
value before combining then the ones taken while the sky is brighter will
inappropriately dominate the result. Dome flats ought, in principle, be
perfectly stable with no time variation in their illumination. In practice,
every light source varies at some level; if you are trying to correct 1%
differences in illumination then 1% fluctuations in the light source matter.</p>
<p>Typically the mean or median is scaled to 1.0 before combining so that when the
science images are divided by the calibrated, combined flats the science image
values do not change too much.</p>
