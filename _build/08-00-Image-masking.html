useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pixel could be "hot," meaning it isn't possible to remove the dark current
from the pixel.</li>
<li>The pixel could be bad in the sense that it does not respond to light the way
the other pixels do.</li>
<li>A cosmic ray can hit the pixel during the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following notebooks walk through identifying each of those types of bad
pixels and how to create a mask for them.</p>
