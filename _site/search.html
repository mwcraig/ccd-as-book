It assumes some basic familiarity with astronomical images and with Python. The inspiration for this work is a pair of guides written for IRAF, “A User’s Guide to CCD Reductions with IRAF” (Massey 1997) and “A User’s Guide to Stellar CCD Photometry with IRAF” (Massey and Davis 1992). The focus is on optical/IR images, not spectra. Software setup The recommended way to get set up to use this guide is to use the Anaconda Python distribution (or the...",

But the ideal scenario does not in fact hold true. A solid understanding of why pixel values are not directly proportional to light is useful before diving into the details of image reduction.

At the end of the previous notebook we arrived at an expression for the counts in a science image in terms of the sources of counts: Solving for the counts just from the stars is as follows: It is impossible to remove the noise from the raw image because the noise is random.

Combining them reduces the noise in the images by roughly a factor of $1/\\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of images being combined.

That combined image will have less noise than the individual images, minimizing the noise added to the remaining images when the dark is subtracted. Regardless of which path you took through the calibration of the biases (with overscan or without) there should be a folder named either example1-reduced or example2-reduced that contains the calibrated bias and dark images.
